# ChatGPT Model Switcher

[English](README.md) | [‰∏≠Êñá](README_zh.md)

ChatGPT Model Switcher is a user script that allows users to enable the GPT-4 Mobile model, ~~thereby overriding GPT-4 usage limits in the ChatGPT web interface~~. It also provides the ability to switch to other models for added flexibility. Generally, this script does not conflict with other popular ChatGPT scripts.

üî¥ Important Notice: It is recommended not to switch models during a single conversation as it might trigger the message: "The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable. We've switched you to the latest default model," potentially leading to unforeseen repercussions.

üîµ Note for Users Without a ChatGPT Plus Subscription: The script automatically hides models that aren't accessible to you in the drop-down menu.

‚ö†Ô∏è Update 2023.12.25: ChatGPT has enhanced its authentication mechanism. You may encounter the following error message during use: "Our systems have detected unusual activity from your system. Please try again later."
