# ChatGPT Model Switcher

[English](README.md) | [ä¸­æ–‡](README_zh.md)

ChatGPT Model Switcher is a user script that allows users to override GPT-4 usage limits in the ChatGPT web interface by enabling the GPT-4 Mobile model. It also provides the ability to switch to other models for added flexibility.

ðŸ”´ Important Notice: It is recommended not to switch models during a single conversation as it might trigger the message: "The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable. We've switched you to the latest default model," potentially leading to unforeseen repercussions.

ðŸ”µ Note for Users Without a ChatGPT Plus Subscription: The script intuitively disables models that aren't accessible to you in the drop-down menu, and it conveniently defaults to the GPT-3.5 model.

## Installation

1. Install a user script manager, such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
2. Click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hydrotho/ChatGPT_Model_Switcher/main/chatgpt-model-switcher.user.js) to install the script.
3. Once installed, visit [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and enjoy using the GPT-4 Mobile model with the "ChatGPT Model Switcher"!

## Usage

To use the GPT-4 Mobile or other models, simply select the desired model from the options on the top-right corner of the ChatGPT web interface.
